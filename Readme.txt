0)The Knowledge graph Analysis

 This notebook is containing the Analysis on our textual data al the process from the cleaning, applying the dependecny parser such as displacy then extration of NER and then building relationships among them and then cleaning along with the weighted KG and Bigrams and trigrams all are done here 

After the Knowledge graph cleaning all the manipulation the Visualization of the KG has been given.

Then the Bigrams and the trigrams are also given separate cells as well 
then the query for the certain types of the cases has also been done in the Notebook.



1) BERT Notebook

This file containes the full implemantation of the BERT on the dataset and also it has the mathew set corealtion function values
BERT is very good when dealing with the textual data and it has the pretrained TF-IDF and it also required to train the model only for the 2 epochs.

3)Bi directional LSTMS AND RNN Notebook

This notebook contains the implemantation of the Bi directional LSTMS and the RNNS while applying the RNN we usually have the problems like gradient vanishing and gradient boosting so we have to use the bidirectional LSTMS which solves these problems very well but due to the lack of the data. 
4) Simple Machine learning Models

Here in this notebook we increased our dataset and we also included the cases which were given by the Stop the traffik after thier manipulation and data cleaning when we applied the Machine learning models such as Random forest, Ada Boost and Gradient boosting when we applied we got very good results.
